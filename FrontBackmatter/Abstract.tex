\chapter*{Abstract}
% The first states the problem.
A key feature of Cloud Computing is to pay proportionally for requested resources. Monitoring is thus essential to finding out the actual resource usage of components. However, existing cloud monitoring solutions are not capable of estimating the deployment cost.
% The second states why the problem is a problem.
As such, cloud consumers have to rely to the billing provided by the cloud provider instead, that is, only deal with cost after the fact.
% The third is my startling sentence.
Our research proposes a model which monitors the deployment cost of an containerized application while it is running, and estimates the waste caused by unused resources provisioned to the application. 
% The fourth states the implication of my startling sentence.
We introduce a scalable and resilient Cloud Monitoring Solution using this model towards allowing for cost optimization on deployment level. We verify this solution by deploying it on an industrial Cloud System.
