\chapter*{Abstract}
% The first states the problem.
A key feature of Cloud Computing is to pay proportionally to the requested resources. Monitoring is thus essential to finding out the actual resource usage of components. Existing Cloud Monitoring solutions are not capable of estimating the deployment cost.
% The second states why the problem is a problem.
As such, it remains unknown for Cloud Consumers how much each component cost and waste.
% The third is my startling sentence.
Our research proposes a model which estimates the deployment cost and predicts the waste caused by unused resources on a container level. 
We introduce a scalable and resilient Cloud Monitoring Solution using this model. We verify this solution by deploying it on an industrial Cloud System.
% The fourth states the implication of my startling sentence.
Using our Cloud Monitoring Solution allows for discovering where resource optimizations are possible.
