As stated in the introduction (\autoref{ch:introduction}), the research question is the following: ``How can the cost and waste monitoring of a Cloud Computing application be offered in a scalable and resilient manner?''. In order to investigate the characteristics of the solution for monitoring a Cloud Computing application, it is important to determine the requirements before. After these requirements are described, the design is provided. 

\section{Requirements} \label{sec:requirements}
As this research is the successor of the work: `Visualizing Computational Waste in Cloud Computing' by A. Spina \cite{spina}, there is some similarity with his requirements. However, as his as important as ...
