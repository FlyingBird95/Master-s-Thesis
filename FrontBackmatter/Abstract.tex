\chapter*{Abstract}
% The first states the problem.
A key feature of Cloud Computing is to pay proportionally to the use of the service by monitoring different metrics with different granularity, according to the type of service and the price model adopted.
% The second states why the problem is a problem.
It is complicated for Cloud Consumers to gather useful insights from monitoring metrics, i.e. to find out which services are demanding the most resources.
% The third is my startling sentence.
This thesis proposes a model for expressing the resources per service in terms of deployment cost and estimating the cost of the resources that are not used in the deployed Cloud System.
% The fourth states the implication of my startling sentence.
Monitoring the cost and waste of running services lead to  optimizing the resources to be used more effectively which affects the amount spent on Cloud Computing.
