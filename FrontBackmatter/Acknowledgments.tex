\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
First of all, I would like to thank V. Andrikopoulos for providing excellent feedback throughout this research. His feedback was steering me in the right direction, while still keeping enough freedom to develop my scientific skills. During the weekly discussions we had, the performed work was evaluated, and new decisions were taken. Apart from supervising my thesis, I want to thank Vasilios for the scientific collaboration over the past two years.\\

\noindent
Another important person that has helped me enormously is Wouter, a technical employee of Sustainable Buildings. His professional behaviour and understanding of the system has lead to many improvements with respect to the final work. During the weekly meetings in the final stage of the thesis, we collected the results. He was able to verify them using his knowledge.
