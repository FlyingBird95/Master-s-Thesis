This chapter analyses the system proposed in \autoref{ch:design}. This analysis is based on evaluating the requirements that are described in \autoref{sec:architectural_req}. Furthermore, this chapter continues the evaluation of the proposed solution by means of an experimental procedure aimed at evaluating its accuracy. This chapter ends with answering the sub questions, as proposed in \autoref{sec:research_question}.

\section{Evaluating architectural requirements}
\autoref{sec:architectural_req} describes the architectural requirements. This section provides a small overview whether the requirements are met. The numbering applies to \autoref{sec:architectural_req}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system has been designed in such a way that it is functional accros
\end{enumerate}


\section{Network traffic accuracy} \label{sec:eval_k}
This section presents the accuracy of network traffic monitoring. In order to do so, a supernode was deployed to monitor two containers. One container acting as a web-service, and one container continuously sending requests. The command for collecting all values can be found below:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption=Docker-compose]
git clone htts://github.com/dadvisor/util
./util/accuracy.sh
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
The idea behind this evaluation is to allow only one container to communicate with the web-service. By doing so, the total amount of data that a container sends is equivalent to its internal amount of data. Thus, the following variables should hold the same value:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{network\_container\_total}: This metric receives a value by scraping data from cAdvisor.
    \item \textbf{bytes\_send\_total}: This metrics has a key-value pair with both `src' and `dst'. This is the amount of data sent between the source container and the destination container by reading the TCPdump data.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
By analysing the rate (per-second average rate of increase) over a time period of one hour, the accuracy can be determined. This can be expressed as the ratio between the two variables above. A perfect estimation would therefore result in a value of $1$. The Prometheus query for analysing the accuracy is presented below.

\begin{verbatim}
rate(network_container_total[5m]) / on (src) 
rate(bytes_send_total[5m])
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
The evaluation has been made for different K values, as proposed in \autoref{sec:exposing_data}. The data obtained for $K = 3$ can be found in \autoref{fig:network_traffic_accuracy}. This figure shows the accuracy of the network traffic monitoring evaluation. Note that this figure shows several spikes, which is due to the difference update frequency of 
both variables. Therefore, the minimum and maximum value represent the boundaries of the accuracy. Furthermore, the accuracy is summarized by computing the average. The results for different K values can be found in \autoref{tab:accuracy_results}.

    \begin{tabular}{r|rrr|r}
        \multirow{2}{*}{K-value} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Accuracy} & \multirow{2}{*}{CPU Usage} \\
        & Min & Max & average & \\ \hline        
        0 & 0.53& 1.22& 1.10& 9\% \\
        3 & 0.52& 1.04& 1.00& 4\% \\
        6 & 0.95& 1.74& 1.66& 3\% \\

        12& 0.93& 1.33& 1.10& 2\% \\
        15& 0.51& 1.11& 1.01& 2\% \\        
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Network traffic accuracy results for different K-values}
    \label{tab:accuracy_results}
\end{table}

\subsection{Conclusion}
From \autoref{tab:accuracy_results} it can be concluded that there is not much variation in the accuracy across different K-values. A reason for this is the fact that the network communication is not enough randomized. Thus, with a constant flow of traffic, the prediction of amount of network communication is too trivial.\\

\noindent
What can be concluded from this table, is the fact that the CPU usage drops if the K-value increases. This is due to a longer sleeping period. However, this number is not very accurate, as the analyses is performed on a single node. Therefore, the overhead of communicating with other nodes is not evaluated.
